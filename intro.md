# Introduction to Deep Learning 

An introduction book to deep learning for college sophomores with a decent high school math background and knowledge of Python. The book should be comprehensive. There should be some light math, and also there should be definitely the Python code. 

## About This Book

**Author:** Dr. Ernesto Lee 

This book contains 8 chapters covering the following topics:

1. **From Neurons to Networks: Understanding the Building Blocks** - Introduces the biological inspiration behind artificial neural networks and covers the mathematical foundations of perceptrons, activation functions, and basic network architecture with Python implementations.
2. **Training Your First Neural Network: The Learning Process** - Explores how neural networks learn through gradient descent, backpropagation, and loss functions, with hands-on Python examples using simple datasets like housing prices and student grades.
3. **Deep Dive into Deep Networks: Multi-Layer Architectures** - Covers the transition from shallow to deep networks, explaining hidden layers, universal approximation theorem, and implementing multi-layer perceptrons using NumPy and introduction to PyTorch.
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks: Seeing Through AI Eyes** - Introduces CNNs for image processing, covering convolution operations, pooling layers, and feature maps, with practical projects including handwritten digit recognition and basic image classification.
5. **Recurrent Neural Networks: Understanding Sequences and Time** - Explores RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs for sequential data processing, with applications in text analysis, sentiment prediction, and simple language modeling using real-world datasets.
6. **Optimization and Regularization: Making Networks Learn Better** - Covers advanced training techniques including different optimizers (Adam, RMSprop), regularization methods (dropout, batch normalization), and hyperparameter tuning with practical optimization strategies.
7. **Popular Architectures: Standing on the Shoulders of Giants** - Surveys influential network architectures like ResNet, VGG, and Transformers, explaining their key innovations and implementing simplified versions for image classification and text processing tasks.
8. **Real-World Applications: Putting It All Together** - Combines concepts from previous chapters to build complete projects including a computer vision application, a natural language processing task, and best practices for model deployment and evaluation.
